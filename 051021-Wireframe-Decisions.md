# Wireframe for Bullet Journal Using Figma

* Status: accepted <!-- optional -->
* Date: 2021-05-10  <!-- optional -->


## Context and Problem Statement

We should keep the wireframe as clean as possible to users. It would be nice  
if users can view/create tasks or go to specific dates with single clicks. But how  
can we achieve this?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Shouldn't make the design simple by reducing features.
* Need `Add Entry` button to show on almost every page.

## Considered Options

* user goes into `my journal`, and creating a file such that the contents will be shown from the `daily/weekly/month` view
* allow users to simply click on the date and let them add important tasks


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: By clicking on “my journal”, this will show all the journal entries that the user has made so far.
               The user can also click on a specific date, which will create an entry in journal.
* convenient, able to be accessed from more than one device
* doesn't eat away at local storage, some users may not have that space

### Local Storage

* Good, because don't need to worry about privacy/info leaks
* Bad, because space concerns
<!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

### Cloud Storage

* Good, because space! Lots of space.
* Good, because can load data from anywhere as long as know where to retrieve from
* Bad, because privacy concers.
 <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->
